<p>After seeing an alarming high rate of teens judging credibility online, we built this tool which anonymized Facebook news article and gamified it so that the users 
can guess who posts it. Our goal was to help users understand their network's biases as well as their own biases. Beforehand, we went through and built other digital literacy and ran multiple
users tests that ultimately led to this tool.</p>

<p>Two of our members presented our process and results in the <a href="https://ethanchiu.xyz/ruhlmanWebLiteracy.pdf">Rulhman Conference</a>.</p>
